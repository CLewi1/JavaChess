To-Do List:

====================
- check

(other pieces can't move unless taking or blocking)

almost fixed, if moves to space piece can attack, able to move, only move to spaces between king and piece

====================


- checkmate (right now must capture king)
- EnPessant
- Castling

- check for draw
- print captured pieces at end

- maybe save multiple games???
